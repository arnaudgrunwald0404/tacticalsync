## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Phase 3 Tests

```bash
# All Phase 3 tests
npx playwright test e2e/agenda/ e2e/instances/ e2e/security/

# Interactive mode (recommended)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Specific feature
npx playwright test e2e/agenda/create-template.spec.ts
```

### Test the Critical Business Rule

```bash
# Verify topics don't carry over between instances
npx playwright test e2e/instances/create-instances.spec.ts -g "do not carry over"
```

---

## 📁 New Files Created (Phase 3)

### Test Files (6)
```
e2e/agenda/create-template.spec.ts     8 tests ✅
e2e/agenda/edit-template.spec.ts      10 tests ✅
e2e/instances/create-instances.spec.ts 11 tests ✅
e2e/instances/edit-topics.spec.ts      9 tests ✅
e2e/security/authorization.spec.ts     7 tests ✅
e2e/security/session-security.spec.ts  5 tests ✅
```

### Helper Libraries (1)
```
e2e/helpers/agenda.helper.ts          13 functions ✅
```

## 💡 Example Tests You Can Run

### Create an Agenda Template
```bash
npx playwright test e2e/agenda/create-template.spec.ts --headed
```
Watch the test:
1. Create template
2. Add multiple items with durations
3. Reorder items
4. Validate in database

### Verify Topics Don't Carry Over (Critical!)
```bash
npx playwright test e2e/instances/create-instances.spec.ts -g "topics from previous" --headed
```
This test verifies a key business rule:
1. Create meeting instance #1
2. Add 3 topics to instance #1
3. Create meeting instance #2
4. ✅ Instance #2 has ZERO topics
5. ✅ Instance #1 still has its 3 topics

### Test Authorization
```bash
npx playwright test e2e/security/authorization.spec.ts --headed
```
Watch security in action:
1. User 1 creates a team
2. User 2 tries to access it
3. ✅ Access denied!

## 🔍 What's Skipped (And Why)

Some tests require features not yet implemented:

### Template-Series Integration (3 tests)
```typescript
test.skip('should apply template when creating instance', ...)
```
**Why**: Integration between templates and series pending  
**When ready**: Remove `.skip()` and tests will run

### Real-time Features (2 tests)
```typescript
test.skip('should add topics during meeting', ...)
```
**Why**: "In progress" meeting state and real-time updates pending  
**When ready**: Implement meeting status, enable tests

### Meeting Locking (4 tests)
```typescript
test.skip('should lock completed meeting instances', ...)
```
**Why**: Meeting lifecycle (in progress/completed/locked) not yet implemented  
**When ready**: Add status field, enable tests

### Advanced Security (4 tests)
```typescript
test.skip('should sanitize HTML in user input', ...)
```
**Why**: XSS sanitization and rate limiting to be verified  
**When ready**: Verify security measures, enable tests

---

## 🎯 Critical Tests Passing

### ✅ Key Business Rules Verified

**Topics DO NOT carry over between instances:**
```typescript
test('topics from previous instance do not carry over', async () => {
  // Instance 1: 3 topics
  // Instance 2 created
  // Instance 2: 0 topics ✅
  // Instance 1: still 3 topics ✅
});
```

**Authorization prevents cross-team access:**
```typescript
test('should enforce team membership on team routes', async () => {
  // User 1 member of Team A
  // User 1 tries to access Team B
  // Access denied ✅
});
```

**UUIDs prevent enumeration:**
```typescript
test('UUIDs make resources not guessable', () => {
  // Team IDs are UUIDs ✅
  // Cannot guess /team/1, /team/2 ✅
});
```
